## miniforge

* Download the conda-forge installer -- https://conda-forge.org/download/
* "Miniforge is the preferred conda-forge installer and includes conda, mamba, and their dependencies."
* https://conda-forge.org/docs/user/transitioning_from_defaults/

Are there any instances where miniforge has encountered security issues that would have been avoided with miniconda?
